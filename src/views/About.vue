    OH HEY! PEOPLE CALL ME
    Glenn Weatherson
    A web developer with a mountain bike problem.
    I live in Reno, Nevada and work over at Noble Studios.

    WAIT, WHAT DO YOU REALLY DO?
    My experience is similar to a variety pack of cold snacks. Starting back in 2006 with freelance life working on a wide variety of clients, continuing to work remotely for an agency on major brands, and working in office at multiple agencies.
    My passion on the web lies in HTML & CSS. I love writing SASS using BEM and making unique designs into rad websites people get to use. I crave trying new things and expanding the brain with new layouts and creative designs.
